# etch-a-sketch

Etch-A-Sketch Project for TOP

Learned a lot on this project. Struggled with event listeners as I originally did not remove them when switching to a different setting.

This caused all kinds of problems but with the help of a member of The Odin Community, I was able to figure it out.

All in all, a fun and challenging project. Onto the next one! :-D
