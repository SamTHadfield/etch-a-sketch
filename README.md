# etch-a-sketch

Etch-A-Sketch Project for TOP

Learned a lot on this project. Once "Darken" button is clicked, it retains its setting, thereby not causing a seamless transition back to "Random" and/or "Color".

I believe this is due to excessive event listeners though I have already spent an inordinate amount of time attempting to debug this and need to move on.

All in all, a fun project :-D
